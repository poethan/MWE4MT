# MWE4MT
PhD Thesis MWE-MT related tools and sources.

This project includes many components, such as:
1. the way to extract English-Chinese MWEs (based on MWEtools, MWEtoolkit, MP-aligner); extracted bilingual en-zh MWEs uploaded in this repository.

1.1 Files wmt18zhen_extractMWE.en and wmt18zhen_extractMWE.zh uploaded here are extracted bilingual English-Chinese MWEs without filtering. 
Two parallel files for Chinese-English (zh-en) 'wmt18zhen_extractMWE.filter85.zh’ and ‘wmt18zhen_extractMWE.filter85.en’ include filtered zh-en MWEs. These four files are already uploaded here in Github.
Alternatively, you can also download these files from the drive link
[ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ZY0qkEgvE5p_fgi89UTR7PzBcDCpQdx?usp=sharing ] all free for research purpose (request might needed)

2. the German-English MWEs corpus and impacts for MT.

2.1 the extracted De-En bilingual MWEs (File "new5m.train.MPOutput_filtered085to100" contain the 3,159,226 parallel MWEs with original PoS information. 
Files "./Copy_of_new5m.train.MPOutput_filtered085to100.en" and "Copy_of_new5m.train.MPOutput_filtered085to100.de" contain the extracted clean en and de MWEs respectively which are line be line aligned with each other. Both these files are in zip file 'MWE_new5m.train.MPOutput_filtered085to100.de_en.zip' in this repository. 

3. integrating MWEs into NMT in various languages.

4. the integration of Chinese radical into NMT (sub-forlder **radical4mt** on Chinese character decomposition work inluding MWE decompositions, discribed in our NoDaLiDa paper below)

MWEs include verbal MWEs (vMWEs) defined in the PARSEME shared task that have a verb as the head of the studied terms. The annotated vMWEs are also bilingually and multilingually aligned manually. The languages covered include English, Chinese, Polish, and German. Our original English corpus is taken from the PARSEME shared task in 2018. We performed machine translation of this source corpus followed by human post editing and annotation of target MWEs. Strict quality control was applied for error limitation, i.e., each MT output sentence received first manual post editing and annotation plus second manual quality rechecking. One of our findings during corpora preparation is that accurate translation of MWEs presents challenges to MT systems. To facilitate further MT research, we present a categorisation of the error types encountered by MT systems in performing MWE related translation. To acquire a broader view of MT issues, we selected four popular state-of-the-art MT models for comparisons namely: Microsoft Bing Translator, GoogleMT, Baidu Fanyi and DeepL MT. Because of the noise removal, translation post editing and MWE annotation by human professionals, we believe our AlphaMWE dataset will be an asset for cross-lingual and multilingual research, such as MT and information extraction. Our multilingual corpora are available as open access at github.com/poethan/AlphaMWE.",

  abstract  = {Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are a hot topic in research in natural language processing (NLP), including topics such as MWE detection, MWE decomposition, and research investigating the exploitation of MWEs in other NLP fields such as Machine Translation. However, the availability of bilingual or multi-lingual MWE corpora is very limited. The only bilingual MWE corpora that we are aware of is from the PARSEME (PARSing and Multi-word Expressions) EU Project. This is a small collection of only 871 pairs of English-German MWEs. In this paper, we present multi-lingual and bilingual MWE corpora that we have extracted from root parallel corpora. Our collections are 3,159,226 and 143,042 bilingual MWE pairs for German-English and Chinese-English respectively after filtering. We examine the quality of these extracted bilingual MWEs in MT experiments. Our initial experiments applying MWEs in MT show improved translation performances on MWE terms in qualitative analysis and better general evaluation scores in quantitative analysis, on both German-English and Chinese-English language pairs. We follow a standard experimental pipeline to create our MultiMWE corpora which are available online. Researchers can use this free corpus for their own models or use them in a knowledge base as model features.},
